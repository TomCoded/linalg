 Linear Algebra Library
 -----------------------------------------

A few point, vector, and matrix operations in a simple C++ linear algebra library. The original version of this, by an anonymous author, was for my undergrad graphics course. The author gave permission for republication and derivative use of their work. This works for playing with the graphics underlying my photon mapper and other projects but would obviously be replaced with a GPU-based library, etc..., for serious graphics work.
